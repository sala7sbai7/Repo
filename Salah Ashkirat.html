     <h3>What A Section Was Most Defficult In The Project</h3>
      <p class="Paragraph">There's sometimes you just feel like your head is overloaded , Not a special moment or special case,
        Sometimes you stuck in a line that misses a small detail that's make our code dosen't work well ,
        The good thing that we have a web and we can always search over the web and find other's whom oneday
        Faced the same situation as you and solved it , So you can make your path shorter to the final results ,
        So there's no certain section to be the most difficult one it's depending to the mood of yourself and for how 
        Long you have been coding , But i still believe the things will get much complicated in the upcoming
        Chalenges.

     <h3>If And Why I Believe That I fit For This World</h3>
      <p class="Paragraph">From the very old days , When i was young even when i was a child i remmember that i was one of the 
        Very first kids to have a computer , The operation system was all about one blue screen and you need 
        To write the file name that you want to open , That was how dos work the operation system , Also i believe
        That theres a room for doing things in other ways , Everything in this world can be better in a way or 
        Other and that includes the programing and codin , Also i real feel my self is so motivated to learn
        This sience and others that related to computer and technology , I would like to add for all what i have 
        Mentioned that am looking for chalenging myself my english language and my abilities so i can keep my
        Brain sharp.
